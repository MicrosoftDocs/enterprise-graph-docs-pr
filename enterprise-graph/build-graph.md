# Quickstart: Build your first graph

This quickstart shows you how to use Enterprise Graph by Microsoft to complete the graph-build process end to end.

You can download the sample files we use for this quickstart <a href="https://ekgdemosamples.blob.core.windows.net/ekgdemosamples01/EGDemo_WWI_Files.zip">here</a>.

## Create an ontology

Your ontology contains the definitions of the entities you want to use and what properties and relationships they have. The ontology defines the entity types, and then later we'll import data to create actual entities. For example, in this step we'll define a 'City' entity that has a 'CityName' property, and later on we'll create actual city entities, for example, Kniman, Cubero, and so on.

All of the steps you will complete in the graph creation process are laid out in the interface:

![All steps](media/quickstart/1-all-steps-overview.png)

To get started, choose **Configure Ontology** from the Overview page, or choose the **Configure your ontology** option from the the left-side navigation.

![Creating your first ontology](media/quickstart/2-create-your-graph-steps.png)

Click on the **+Add** button, and you'll see the **Create ontology** pane.

![Create ontology](media/quickstart/4-create-ontology-options.png)

In this pane, you can see there are options to create an ontology from scratch, modify one of the Microsoft-supplied ontologies, or import an existing ontology. For now, we're going to import an existing ontology, based on the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/wide-world-importers-what-is?view=sql-server-2017">World Wide Importers sample data</a>.

In the ontology pane, choose a suitable name (like 'WWI'), add a description if you want, choose the 'Import' option from the 'Add ontology from' dropdown, and then choose the '01_WWIOntology.json' file from the sample files.

![Upload ontology](media/quickstart/6-upload-ontology.png)

Once the ontology is created, you can examine the different entity types and the attributes they have through the browser. In the screenshot below for example, we can see the ```Application.Cities``` entity type. We can also see that two other entities link to the ```Cities``` entities - ```Purchasing.Suppliers``` and ```Sales.Customers```. We can also see that ```Application.Cities``` itself links to the entity ```Application.StateProvinces``` with a link type of 'StateProvinceID' showing the province the city is located in.

![Upload ontology](media/quickstart/7-ontology-uploaded.png)

To complete this step, choose **Publish** to make your ontology live.

> [!TIP]
> If you don't publish your ontology here, you won't be able to complete the later steps.

## Create and map source schema

Now that we have our ontology in place, we can move to the next step: relating the ontology to your source data. Your 'source data' is the data you intend to upload to your graph.

First, we want to tell the system what fields your source data contains. Your source data must be formatted as a TSV, and in this step 'Sample data' means a sample of the data you ultimately intend to upload.

In the sample data we've provided, there are five source schemas:

1. 02_Schema_Application.Cities.json
1. 03_Schema_Application.Countries.json
1. 04_Schema_Application.StateProvinces.json
1. 05_Schema_Application.People.json
1. 06_Schema_Sales.Customers.json

In each case, what the source schema is saying is: 'These are the headings of the data I intend to upload.'

![Source schema step](media/quickstart/12-add-source-schema.png)

1. Click on **+Add** to upload a source schema file
1. Choose an appropriate name, for example, 'Application-People'
1. Choose the 'Upload a JSON file' option
1. Choose the 02_Schema_Application.Cities.json file to upload

You'll see the file previewed in 'Sample Data' window, and you can click OK.

Repeat these steps for all of the source schema files, and you'll see a view like this:

![All schemas](media/quickstart/15-all-schema-uploaded.png)

You'll see that the last column says 'No fields mapped'. In other words, we have defined our ontology and we've defined what our source data looks like, but we have not defined the links between them. We'll add this mapping now.

Click on **No fields mapped** for Cities, and then choose ```wwi.ApplicationCities``` as the **Target Entity** on the left-hand side.

![Entity-mapping view](media/quickstart/17-mapping-app-cities.png)

On the left you're seeing your ontology (specifically, the entity for cities) and on the right you're seeing the schema map of your own data.

Next we want to specify that CityName in our input data should be the source data for the ```type.object.name``` property for the ```wwi:Application.Cities``` entity type. To do that, we select CityName on the right, then click on type.object.name on the left.

![Mapping CityName](media/quickstart/18-mapping-name.png)

Once you click 'OK', you'll see confirmation this mapping is now in place:

![Mapping CityName](media/quickstart/19-mapping-complete.png)

To complete this step, we have provided XML mapping data files. Go ahead and upload those now for each of the provided files. In each case, choose the entity and the matching mapping file:

* wwi: Application.Cities -> 07_Mapping_Application.Cities.xml
* wwi: Application.Countries -> 08_Mapping_Application.Countries.xml
* wwi: Application.StateProvinces -> 09_Mapping_Application.StateProvinces.xml
* wwi: Application.People -> 10_Mapping_Application.People.xml
* wwi: Sales.Customers -> 11_Mapping_Sales.Customer.xml

When you upload the file, you'll see the mapping complete view:

![Countries mapping example](media/quickstart/20-mapping-complete.png)

And then when you click 'Verify', you'll see the final mapping in place:

![Countries mapping example](media/quickstart/21-mapping-verify.png)

When you've complete the mapping step, you can see the schema mapping status for each of your source schemas:

![All mapping complete](media/quickstart/23-all-mapping-complete.png)

Now that source schemas and schema maps are in place, we can ingest data to the graph.

## Ingest data

The input data for your graph comes from the input data you want to use in a TSV format. The easiest way to handle the import is to use Azure Blob Storage, and that is where we have put the sample data for you import. The URLs for each kind of sample data are:

* https://ekgdemosamples.blob.core.windows.net/ekgdemosamples01/12.1_Ingestion_Application.Cities.tsv
* https://ekgdemosamples.blob.core.windows.net/ekgdemosamples01/12.2_Ingestion_Application.Countries.tsv
* https://ekgdemosamples.blob.core.windows.net/ekgdemosamples01/12.3_Ingestion_Application.StateProvinces.tsv
* https://ekgdemosamples.blob.core.windows.net/ekgdemosamples01/12.4_Ingestion_Application.People.tsv
* https://ekgdemosamples.blob.core.windows.net/ekgdemosamples01/12.5_Ingestion_Sales.Customers.tsv

Navigate to the **Ingest data to graph** section, choose **+Add** at the top, and you will options for 'Source URL' and 'Source Schema':

![All mapping complete](media/quickstart/23-all-mapping-complete.png)

'Source URL' is where your input data can be found (that is, in this case the blob store URL we provided above), and 'Source Schema' is the source schema we created in step (2) above to map this input data.

When the ingestion completes, you'll see this view:

![First ingestion complete](media/quickstart/25-first-ingestion-complete.png)

Repeat the process for each source data TSV and matching source schema, and you'll see:

![All ingestions complete](media/quickstart/26-all-ingestions-complete.png)

##  Query your graph

Your first graph on the Enterprise Graph platform is complete, congratulations! To run a simple text query, navigate to the **Use your graph** section of the interface from the left-hand navigation pane, and choose 'Entity Search'. Enter the query 'kniman', and you should see:

![Free text search](media/quickstart/27-search-free-text.png)

You can click on the entity name to see the details the graph contains about it:

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you built your first graph. The next step is conflation, which you can learn about later in this guide.
